# Solar-Panel-Adjuster
The project uses Arduino Uno to develop a solar panel adjuster.
It aims at following solar movement to ensure the sun rays fall on the panel perpendicularly throughout the day, thereby maximizing intensity and energy production.

The Arduino code can be found in the LDR_Solar_Panel Sketch.
Refer to the Report document for a detailed description of the hardware components and the development of the same.
